    "text": "Definition of Biometrics\nThe terms “Biometrics” and “Biometry” have been used since early in the 20th century to refer to the field of development of statistical and mathematical methods applicable to data analysis problems in the biological sciences.\nStatistical methods for the analysis of data from agricultural field experiments to compare the yields of different varieties of wheat, for the analysis of data from human clinical trials evaluating the relative effectiveness of competing therapies for disease, or for the analysis of data from environmental studies on the effects of air or water pollution on the appearance of human disease in a region or country are all examples of problems that would fall under the umbrella of “Biometrics” as the term has been historically used.\nThe journal “Biometrics” is a scholarly publication sponsored by a non-profit professional society (the International Biometric Society) devoted to the dissemination of accounts of the development of such methods and their application in real scientific contexts.\nRecently, the term “Biometrics” has also been used to refer to the emerging field of technology devoted to identification of individuals using biological traits, such as those based on retinal or iris scanning, fingerprints, or face recognition. Neither the journal “Biometrics” nor the International Biometric Society is engaged in research, marketing, or reporting related to this technology. Likewise, the editors and staff of the journal are not knowledgeable in this area."

    "text": "Welcome to the website for the Australasian Region of the International Biometric Society.\nOur region comprises members of the International Biometric Society (IBS) that predominantly reside in Australia and New Zealand. Currently, membership numbers are over 200.\nProfessionally, we are statisticians, biometricians, mathematicians, scientists and managers, from academia, consulting or research and development, with biological applications being the common link. Biological applications include medicine, public health, ecology, environmental science, agriculture, genetics, microbiology and toxicology, amongst others.\nOur employers range from local and commonwealth government agencies where there may be a team of biometricians employed, to private institutions which may only employ one biometrician.\nWe offer student scholarships and financial support to attend conferences on a regular basis. See our Prizes/Awards page.\nThe presentations for the talks at the Biometrics in the Bay of Islands conference are now online. There are purple links to the PowerPoints or PDFs in the schedule under each author who provided these."
