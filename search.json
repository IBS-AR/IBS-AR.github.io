    "text": "Definition of Biometrics\nThe terms “Biometrics” and “Biometry” have been used since early in the 20th century to refer to the field of development of statistical and mathematical methods applicable to data analysis problems in the biological sciences.\nStatistical methods for the analysis of data from agricultural field experiments to compare the yields of different varieties of wheat, for the analysis of data from human clinical trials evaluating the relative effectiveness of competing therapies for disease, or for the analysis of data from environmental studies on the effects of air or water pollution on the appearance of human disease in a region or country are all examples of problems that would fall under the umbrella of “Biometrics” as the term has been historically used.\nThe journal “Biometrics” is a scholarly publication sponsored by a non-profit professional society (the International Biometric Society) devoted to the dissemination of accounts of the development of such methods and their application in real scientific contexts.\nRecently, the term “Biometrics” has also been used to refer to the emerging field of technology devoted to identification of individuals using biological traits, such as those based on retinal or iris scanning, fingerprints, or face recognition. Neither the journal “Biometrics” nor the International Biometric Society is engaged in research, marketing, or reporting related to this technology. Likewise, the editors and staff of the journal are not knowledgeable in this area."

    "text": "As reported in the February 2012 IBS-AR newsletter, the Australasian Region of the International Biometric Society created the ‘ALF’ award, named after E.A. (Alf) Cornish who was the first (vice-) president of the Australasian Region, from 1948-1950, and IBS President during 1956-1957. More information about Alf’s career is here.\nThe award is for recognition of a current member in the Australasian Region who has given ‘longtime’ service to the Biometric Society and to the advancement of biometry. The nominated member should have been a member for the minimum of the last 5 years.\nMembers are invited to submit an application to the Secretary with the nomination of a member who may be eligible to be considered. The closing date for nominations is three months before the starting date of our biennial conferences, typically about the end of August."
